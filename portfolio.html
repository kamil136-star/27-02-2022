                      <p>Greats are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for millennials to come. One such great, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, was born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October 1931 to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income. </p>

                    <summary>Aryabhatta</summary>
                    <p>
                        Aryabhatta was the first mathematician and astronomer of India. He had acquired vast knowledge in
                         the field of mathematics. He also discovered several things for which Indians feel proud of even
                          now. His renowned discoveries were algebraic identities, trigonometric functions, the value of 
                          pi, and the place value system, etc. Aryabhatta wrote many famous books which are treated as 
                          Bible in Mathematics. Many youngsters were inspired by Aryabhatta in the field of mathematics. 
                          His contribution to society is highly acclaimed to date.Early Life Aryabhatta was born in 475
                           A.D. in an unknown place. But according to his book ‘Aryabhatiya’, he lived in Kusumpura, the
                            modern-day Patna. The archaeologists hold this belief till today that he continued his studies
                             in Kusumpura. The reason behind the beliefs is his significant works of astronomy were found
                              in Kusumpura.Therefore, it can be believed that Aryabhatta spent most of his life in this 
                              place. Besides this, it is believed by some historians that he was the head of the Nalanda
                               University in Kusumpura. All of the aforementioned theories are based on guesses and 
                               hypotheses because no proper evidence is there except the books written by Aryabhatta
                               . Some of the records were lost and are not found until now. Contributions of Aryabhatta
                                The major contribution of Aryabhatta was in the field of mathematics. Various 
                               trigonometric functions were discovered by him which are very much relevant in modern-day 
                               mathematics. Aryabhatta’s invention regarding the value of ‘pi’ eradicates the 
                               complications in mathematics. But, his invention of place value and zero is the
                                masterstroke in the domain of mathematics. There are many astronomical theories written
                                 in the book ‘Aryabhatiya’. Aryabhatta was not only efficient in Mathematics but he also
                                  had immense knowledge of astronomy. According to his heliocentric theory, planets 
                                  revolve around the sun. He calculated the speed of the various planets concerning 
                                  the Sun with the help of his theory. The sidereal rotation was also calculated by 
                                  him. One of his major discoveries in the field of astronomy was the sidereal year 
                                  which states that it should be 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds in a 
                                  year. This deviates from the present-day value by only 3 minutes and 20 seconds. 
                                  It was Aryabhatta who correctly discovered the fact that the earth rotates on its 
                                  axis. He also anticipated the geocentric model of the solar system which said the
                                   earth to be the centre of the universe. The sun, the moon, and the planets rotate
                                    around it. Solar and lunar eclipses were also described in his book. The fact that 
                                    solar eclipse and lunar eclipse take place due to the shadow-casting of the earth 
                                    and the moon was explained in his book.  It can be said that the approximations made
                                     by Aryabhatta in the field of astronomy were very much accurate. The core of the computational paradigm is generated by 
                                     the theories of Aryabhatta. As Indian citizens, we should feel proud of Aryabhatta because he had invented such things which can’t be imagined in the present day without the facilities of modern equipment. </p>

                        <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.
            
                            UNESCO defines three main learning settings.[2] Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal learning occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. [3] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal settings occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[4] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.
                            
                            Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.
                            
                            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

                            Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.
                            
                            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>
